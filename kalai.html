  <h4><p>Virat Kohli is an Indian cricketer, widely regarded as one of the greatest batsmen of all time. Born on November 5, 1988, in Delhi, India, he has established himself as a dominant force in international cricket with his aggressive batting style, consistency, and leadership. A right-handed batsman, Kohli has broken numerous records across all formats of the game, including being the fastest to reach multiple run milestones in One Day Internationals (ODIs). He is the first cricketer to score 50 ODI centuries, surpassing Sachin Tendulkar’s long-standing record. Kohli captained the Indian team in all three formats until 2021-22, leading them to several historic victories, including India's first-ever Test series win in Australia in 2018-19. In the Indian Premier League (IPL), he has been a key player for Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) and holds the record for most runs in a single IPL season, scoring 973 in 2016. His intense fitness regimen has revolutionized Indian cricket’s approach to fitness standards. Off the field, he is married to Bollywood actress Anushka Sharma, and they have a daughter named Vamika. With over 26,000 international runs and countless accolades, Kohli remains a symbol of dedication, passion, and excellence in cricket.</h4></p>
